# 🧠 NULLSHOT OPERATOR (Manager Agent)

**The Neural Cortex of the Sentinel Protocol.**

This agent serves as the central orchestrator for the system. Built on the **Nullshot Framework**, it handles goal decomposition, task routing, and multi-agent consensus.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Nullshot](https://nullshot.ai/)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible
- **Coordination**: LLM-driven planning & execution

## 🚀 Capabilities

- **Goal Decomposition**: Breaks down high-level user intents (e.g., "Analyze this market") into atomic executable steps.
- **Orchestration**: Directs the `Registry` to find workers and the `Vault` to pay them.
- **Consensus**: Aggregates results from multiple sub-agents to form a cohesive final output.
